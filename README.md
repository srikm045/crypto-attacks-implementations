# crypto-attacks-implementations
Implementations and analyses of OTP variations, block cipher modes, and cryptographic attacks (AES-CBC, ECB, CTR, Padding Oracle)

Overview:
This repository contains my self-reading cryptography projects, based on lab-style challenges from IIT Bombayâ€™s Cryptography course. It covers practical implementations of OTP, block cipher modes, and cryptanalysis attacks.

Labs & Highlights:

Lab 1: One-Time Pad Variations
Two-time pad recovery attack
OTP over groups
Faulty OTP distinguish attack

Lab 2: Block Cipher Modes
ECB redundancy analysis
Key-as-IV exploit
CTR mode vulnerability
